\section{Education}

\cventry{2018--Current}{Master's Programme in Mathematical Sciences (Statistics)}{\newline University of Gothenburg \& Chalmers University of Technology}{\newline Gothenburg, Sweden}{\newline\textbf{Courses}: Linear Statistical Models, Computational Methods for Bayesian Statistics, Probability Theory, Machine Learning}{}

\cventry{2011--2016}{Mathematics \& Computer Science Bachelor of Science}{\newline California State University}{Northridge, USA}{}{}

\section{Work Experience}

\cventry{August 2016 - June 2018}{Programmer/Analyst}{CRESST/UCLA}{Los Angeles}{}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Worked on research projects involving natural language processing (NLP) using Python with focus on similarity between sentences.
    \item Created an interactive game using Angular2/Ionic where a student attempts to solve tasks by programming an on-screen vehicle and solve tasks to measure reasoning and problem solving.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Conducted multiple data collections at high schools across Los Angeles where around one hundred students were involved in the data collection.
      \item Event data was analyzed and exploratory analysis was conducted to summarize student's problem solving and reasoning abilities.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{April 2014 - May 2016}{Data Scientist, Intern}{Caltech/JPL}{Pasadena}{}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Managed data processing pipeline for Cassini and Dawn missions which includes Scala/Apache Spark ingest code and managing Elasticsearch cluster.
  \item Worked on an API that provides a common interface to mission's telemetry data which supports data visualization dashboards.
  \item Wrote parsers to bring old proprietary data formats into common and modern formats. Included XML parsing, web scraping, and Scala's parser combinators.
  \item Lead a project to extract data, using Apache Tika, from word documents into MongoDB. Data was then displayed through a web application, written in AngularJS, to allow easy searching and downloading.
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Sep 2013 - April 2014}{Software Developer, Intern}{Caltech/JPL}{Pasadena}{}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Processed atmospheric data with Python.
\item Automated repetitive tasks in data processing pipeline with bash and python scripts.
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{June 2013 - Aug 2013}{Data Scientist, Intern}{Caltech/JPL}{Pasadena}{}{
%\textit{Intern} -
\begin{itemize}
\item Assisted different projects and created many high visibility prototypes to help describe and visualize data to supplement research.
\item Worked with R, Python, for data analysis and visualizations.
\end{itemize}
